The ProTraderAI-Frontend architecture is integrated with the ProTraderAI-AI trading engine and ProTraderAI-backend architecture via API, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing and managing stock trading information, including user portfolios and management. The API acts as a bridge between the ProTraderAI-Frontend architecture, ProTraderAI-AI engine, and ProTraderAI-backend architecture, allowing the three systems to exchange data and information in real-time.

The frontend architecture provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and managing stock trading information, including a user's portfolio. Traders can view and manage their portfolios, including the stocks they own, their current value, and any recent trades. The frontend architecture also provides real-time updates on portfolio performance, allowing traders to track the value of their investments and make informed decisions.

The API enables the frontend architecture to receive real-time updates from the backend architecture and AI engine, allowing traders to access the latest market data and trade information. The API also enables traders to send trade instructions to the AI engine, which are then executed by the system.

The integration of the frontend architecture with the AI trading engine and backend architecture via API provides a comprehensive solution for automating the stock trading process, helping traders to access and manage their portfolios quickly and easily. The API also enables the frontend architecture to keep a log of all trades and decisions made by the AI engine, providing transparency and accountability for all transactions.
